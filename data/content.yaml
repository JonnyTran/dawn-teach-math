  - question: "What is the late work policy?"
    answer: |
      Late work only applies to homework assigned when a student is present in class. If a student is absent the day homework is assigned, please see the missed assignments policy below.

      Students are responsible for making up missed assignments. Late work may be graded up to a 70 and can be submitted until the 9-week grading period is over. Late work cannot be made up after the grading period is over unless a student's average is below passing.

      It is possible to receive full credit for late work if a student has an excused absent between the assigned date and the due date. Please submit the assignment within 5 days of the absence and email Ms. Tran for a grade update.

      In extenuating circumstances that severely prevents a student from completing class work, please have a parent or guardian contact Ms. Tran.
